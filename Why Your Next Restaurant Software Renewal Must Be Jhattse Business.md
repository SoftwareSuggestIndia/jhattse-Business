# Why Your Next Restaurant Software Renewal Must Be  [**Jhattse Business**](https://business.jhattse.com)

In 2026, running a successful restaurant isn’t just about great food—it’s about having the right **operating system** for your business. As legacy POS providers hike renewal rates and lock you into outdated hardware, thousands of Indian restaurateurs are making a smarter, more strategic switch.

If your current software license is up for renewal this year, you’re not just renewing a subscription—you’re deciding whether to stay stuck in operational chaos or leap into a streamlined, future-ready kitchen.

Here’s why [**Jhattse Business**](https://business.jhattse.com) has become the go-to choice for cloud kitchens, QSRs, cafes, and full-service restaurants across India.

### 1. End “Tablet Hell” with True Aggregator Integration

For years, owners juggled separate screens for Zomato, Swiggy, billing, and inventory—wasting time, increasing errors, and burning staff energy.  

**The Jhattse Advantage:**  
Jhattse offers **native, real-time API integration** with Zomato and Swiggy. When an order comes in, it instantly appears in your POS, triggers an automatic KOT print in the kitchen, and updates your inventory—all without a single manual keystroke.

**The Result?**  
✔️ Save **10–15 labor hours per week**  
✔️ Eliminate wrong-item orders and customer complaints  
✔️ Focus staff on service—not data entry

### 2. Radically Transparent Pricing—No Hidden Traps

- **Super Plan**: **₹7,999 + GST/year** — Adds table management, loyalty tools, and advanced sales insights

### 3. Inventory That Thinks Like a Chef: Recipe-Based Stock Control

Most billing software only tracks *what you sold*. Jhattse tracks *what you actually used*—thanks to **Bill of Materials (BOM) intelligence**.

Link each dish to its ingredients (e.g., 200g paneer per Paneer Tikka), and every time you bill, your raw stock automatically deducts in real time.

**Why it matters:**  
- Get **low-stock alerts** before you run out mid-service  
- Identify **non-moving items** to reduce spoilage  
- Cut food waste by up to **15%**—directly boosting your margins

- **Send digital bills** directly to customers’ WhatsApp—eco-friendly, instant, and professional  
- **Run targeted campaigns**: Birthday offers, festive discounts, or happy hour alerts  
- Achieve **5x higher open rates** than email or SMS—because messages come from *your business*, not a faceless number
