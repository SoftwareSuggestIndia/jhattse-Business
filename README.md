## 🌟 Why Modern Restaurants Choose Jhattse

Legacy POS systems were built for *cash registers*. Jhattse was built for *growth*.

| Pain Point | Jhattse’s Solution | Real Impact |
|-----------|-------------------|-------------|
| 💸 High aggregator commissions (25–30%) | ✅ **Free branded storefront** + direct QR ordering | → Saves ₹15–30/order |
| 🧩 Orders scattered across 5+ apps | ✅ **Unified dashboard** for Zomato, Swiggy, Amazon, Flipkart, Shopify | → 40% faster order processing |
| 📉 No repeat customers (no engagement) | ✅ **Native WhatsApp CRM** — auto-invoices, feedback, offers | → 2.8x repeat order rate |
| 📦 Inventory waste & recipe costing errors | ✅ **BOM + real-time stock tracking** | → 30–50% less spoilage |
| 🖥️ Expensive hardware & ₹10k+ setup | ✅ **BYOD** — runs on any Android/iOS device or browser | → ₹0 capex, launch in <1 hour |

> 📌 *“We shifted from Petpooja in 1 day. Now 32% of orders are direct — saving ₹2.4L/month.”*  
> — *Founder, 4-brand cloud kitchen (Bangalore)*
