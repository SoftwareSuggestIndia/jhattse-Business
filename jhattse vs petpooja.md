| **Category** | ✅ **Jhattse Business** | ⚠️ **Petpooja** |
|-------------|-------------------------|-----------------|
| **Core Architecture** | Cloud-native, mobile-first (works on any Android/iOS device or browser) | Legacy client-server; Windows-centric; often requires on-premise hardware |
| **Setup & Onboarding** | **₹0 setup fee**<br>→ Go live in **<10 minutes** via self-serve signup<br>→ 1-click CSV menu import (supports Petpooja/Zomato formats) | ₹10,000–₹25,000+ non-refundable setup<br>→ 2–3 days typical onboarding (often requires vendor visit) |
| **Pricing Model** | Transparent SaaS:<br>- Free tier available<br>- Pro: ₹499/month (all features included)<br>- No hidden SMS/hardware fees | High CapEx + OpEx:<br>- Annual licensing (₹7.5k–₹10k+)<br>- SMS packs (₹0.20–₹0.35/SMS)<br>- Training, updates, and data exports often billed separately |
| **Zomato & Swiggy Integration** | ✅ **Native, real-time sync** in unified dashboard<br>→ Auto-acknowledge, prevent duplicates, track status | ✅ Supported, but UI fragmented<br>→ Often requires tab-switching between modules |

| **Customer Engagement** | ✅ **Native WhatsApp integration**:<br>- Auto-invoices, feedback, offers<br>- CRM with segmentation & automation<br>✅ No SMS cost | ❌ SMS-only outreach<br>→ Customers ignore 85%+ of SMS (industry avg)<br>→ No native WhatsApp or automation |
| **Inventory & BOM** | ✅ Real-time stock tracking<br>✅ **Recipe/BOM management** (link raw material → finished dish)<br>✅ Low-stock & non-moving alerts ([Techjockey](https://www.techjockey.com/detail/jhattse)) | ✅ Advanced inventory (but complex setup)<br>⚠️ BOM requires manual configuration<br>⚠️ Reports often capped at 6–12 months |

| **Multi-Location Support** | ✅ Centralized dashboard for inventory, sales, staff<br>✅ Multi-brand support (ideal for cloud kitchens) | ✅ Available in enterprise tiers<br>⚠️ Complex licensing, higher cost per outlet |
| **User Interface** | ✅ Modern, minimalist, touch-optimized<br>✅ Minimal training needed ([Techjockey user: *“easy to use… very little staff training”*](https://www.techjockey.com/detail/jhattse)) | ⚠️ Dated UI, dense menus, steep learning curve for new staff |
